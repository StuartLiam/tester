bool completed		#Whether or not the task was completed.
int32 task_id #we need to know the id when tasks is returning, since multiple instances of the same task type may return to same callback in task handler. If we don't know the tasks id, we won't be sure what instance it is, and the callback only receives Result info, which doesn't include the task_id outlined for this actions goal.
string final_state 	#Since tasks are based on a state machine, this can contain the final state that was reached upon completion/termination.
