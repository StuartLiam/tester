# ====== DO NOT MODIFY! AUTOGENERATED FROM AN ACTION DEFINITION ======
#Any task being done by the Task Handler will have the form of this action. This is essentially the TaskRequest.msg except trimmed down to only include parameters. the TaskHandler doesn't care about a tasks id and status, just the task to be done and the info regarding it.

#Goal parameters. Specified at runtime. If you are trying to pass complex data to a task (list of points/etc), you will have to encode it as a string, or however you'd like.
